        <h1>  Identity, Values, and Strengths </h1>
<br>

<h2>
    Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. 


</h2>

<br>

this one time i saved up a bit of dough for a few weeks on the beni and stayed home so 
i could give that money to a homeless person in town, 
i thought that i needed to make that happen at least once so they could have some money since i didnt need it pretty much at all.
<br>
i dont regret doing it but i feel like next time i shouldnt just give it to the first homeless person i could find... 
<br>

<br>

<h2>
    Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.

</h2>


<br>

Mostly spending time by myself made me more of who i am then those around me in the more recent time that has led me to now.
over the long term i feel like its mostly younger age and when you get older your thoughts change and when your alone what 
you tend to think about can evolve and lead you to learning more about yourself then anyone else can show you, its a whole process
that influences your life choice and many other outcomes that create life changing experience, 
like the pursuit of dreams and innovation that resonates with who you are that is shared with others.

<h2>
    Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.

</h2>



<br>
My strengths are seen thru expaining what im learning so the process of reading to reflecting 
and making that process as structured as i can would allow to me take my learning experience to a level 
of satisfaction not only for my self but for others who struggle with the same thing.


<h2>
    Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. <br>
    How might these affect your learning journey?

</h2>


<br>

the effects of aphantasia show a challenge for me to overcome for the process of learning, 
the way it effects my learning journey to what i can see if that if learn a way to unlock 
capabilites relevant to visualiation ill be able to share it as it would be found thru 
the creation of a technology.  

<br>

<br>


<h2>
    Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,<br> but there was resistance or tension. 

</h2>
<br>



    I dont really have tension with others in a learning environment, if there is i usually try help anyway i can think of.
    i dont like being rude and things so i like to make sure that i keep the peace if i can. i would be supportive of others
    that show signs of not having a very positive experience, theres always a time for a break to do other things and i beilve that 
    its important to acknowledge that as life can be to short to think that work is a dominant force that limits the capabilty to enjoy it.
