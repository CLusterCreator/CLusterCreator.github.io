        <h3> Learning Plan </h3>
<br>


        <h2> What is my long term goal or career pathway </h2>

 <p>

 Once i have the skills nesssary to build my dream project
 i will begin my venture towards the sucessful accomplishment of financial freedom 
 and enlightenment to share with those who surround me now and who i will be with as time proceeds,
 cluster will open so many doors to meet new people not only for me but for everyone that uses it
 so my career will align with my choices as a developer to maintain cluster and continue its evolution
 for the purpose of channeling life experiences towards a greater educated choice. 
 
 <br>

 I have plans for technology in the future that could channel AI to be less of its own mind and more of 
 an extension of the user, this has the potential to evolve human capabilities of technology so im looking forwards
 to spending time contemplating ways the option is benefical for the future. 
<br>

<h2> A description of my strengths and limitations when it comes to learning </h2>

<p>

I find that my strengths are seen most once I get the chance to explain what im learning,
the process of learning and installing the topic into my brain is a bit more difficult but 
once i have a chance to explain things the knowledge becomes a whole lot more clear.
<br>

<br>
Limitations I have involve aphantasia, which is the inability to produce mental imagery/visualization 
this makes it harder for me to figure out problems ect, but i can draw and use physical movements to elaborate a bit futher 
then i would without them. other then that i feel like limitations are time and knowledge i would really just need 
time and knowning a bit more about problem solving techniques that aid with aphantasia and i would be doing much better. 
<br>
<br>
a way around this thru what i have thought about is with technology, 
if i were to build a controller and use apple glasses or an AR headset with an app that is made for both 
to work together i would be able to visualise so thats another goal i have for the future.

<h2> The skills (non-technical core/human skills) I would like to see developed in myself while at Dev Academy </h2>
 
 <p>

Id be keen to develop the ability to learn faster, so not only with the topic of study but within experiences in general
and like problem solving. I've recently come to a realisation when contemplating that when you mind the moment with the 
perception or thought of learning it, your kind of always in a state of learning, and channeling this towards a more chosen 
outcome then just learning whats happenin in the senses could be far more vibrant then what i know now.

</p>

 <br>

<h2> commitment to how I will manage my workload in this program </h2>
 

<p>

    ill make sure i level up enough to pass this academys acceptance of education
    thru the succeeding efforts of mental philosphy that allows for the procedures of learning within
    positive health, friendship and utilised optional life experiences that aligns with the choices 
    of making the most out of the time i have with dev.

<br>
    when things get difficult im going to contact who seems best suited to help me through 
    and make definte the competion of each task. 

<br>
    Learning ways to break down the work load is all apart of running a large business so im thankful for
    the teachings involved in the handbook and ill put them to use and evolve what i can thru my career 

</p>

<br>
 
<h2> A commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way </h2>
    
 <p>
    
    Thanks to discord and npm im confident i can find others and techniques to complete my goals within the time im given.

     </p>


     <br>

<h2> A description of what I expect from the facilitation team </h2>
 
<p>

I dont have many or any really, im happy to be suprised by something because of how it is when something suprising happens that makes
sense to the learning topic. something i would like to happen that i guess might not is learning everything i need to to make my 
project, just because thats what im trying to do here. 


</p>


<br>


<h2> Schenduling notes </h2>

<p> 
I'm all set for this study time, i dont have any limitations for anything that i thinks going to happen just yet
so im freed up. If anything comes up thats important enough then ill be letting the team know for sure
