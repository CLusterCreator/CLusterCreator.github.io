How would you describe the command line 
in plain English in a couple of sentences? 
Can you think of an analogy for it?

 - its a command line that utilises commands 
 for simpler user of the computer as a web developer to help save time 
 

Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?

 - i felt like i progressed thru it faster then what 
 was expected. i may not need to change things 


What's the difference between Git and GitHub?


- The most widely used Version Control Software is called Git

Git doesn't require any remote servers for its operation - 
it can be installed on your computer. For easy access and collaboration, 
web developers use GitHub (the largest code host on the planet) for storing and sharing code.

GitHub is a company that provides file hosting online

Can you think of an analogy to describe them?

one is downloaded and on is online 


 
Do you think you would still remember the difference a week 
from now if you didn't revisit the material?

maybe yeah i think if i spent enough time on 
them for the first week it would be in the memory 


Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?

 - i spent enough time for me to feel like 
 i had a good idea about what was required to learn

what is a git workflow

 - a workflow of the use of git thru the process of creating 
   branches and merging branches to the main.


 what did you notice about your learning, what did you do when 
 you were confused or blocked . 

 - my learning is slower right now as  i know my focus is on my 
 main goals thru completion of the study so i am taking notes mainly for what i would need to use to build my project website. 


is there anyting you would do differently if you were to 
repeat this learning exploration 

 - i wouldnt do much different to be honest. if i 
 knew more about the content i would focus mainly on my goals of 
 learning and clarify anything that would be useful that i had learnt the first time thru.

how would you discribe stage and commit 
to your non tech savy friends
 
 - commit saves the recent activity to the repository or git cloud. 
   so its kinda like a check point for the recent activity on your website

Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. 
Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, 
the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.



 - i decided to change my life towards the guidance of god, i 
 had experienced a spiitual awakening and the experiences had 
 led to me to the belief many things i never would have thought were real.. 
 i started to donate to chairty and begin my theoretical discoveries of creator 
 power and the universal philosphys. this had led to me try create positive karma for my life. 



Describe how your culture and the people 
around you have influenced your values and identity.

 - i think the culture i had been raised around wasnt the truth 
 of my spirituality so discovering that to me and to most people is truly finding yourself as independent 



Identify your strengths and how they will support 
you during your learning journey.

 - strengths to me involve your capability to operate within a 
 category from the pallet of options you are gifted with. 
 as i have my direction algined i know what i need to learn and my eyes spark 
 when i find pieces within this course that help me bring my project together. 
 so the strength to know what is required for my future is apart of what will help me on my study journey with dev 



Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. 
How might these affect your learning journey?


 - my limitation so far to me show that i feel like im more focused
  on what i feel like i need for my goals, so if i stay this way i might miss something that could be more benefical for other areas of my profession. 


Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, 
but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, 
how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.

 - ive never really had a time like this as im cooperative with others in a team. 
 i usually just contribute what i belive will help problem solve anyway i can think of
