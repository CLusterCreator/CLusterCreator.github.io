<br>My names Taylor<br>

<br>
I've been thinking about how my identity is usally always developing in 
terms of values and life experience which aligns a choice we have about ourselves
so i would say that i like to think of myself as a learner. 
<br>
<br>
im attending dev academy so i can build a social networking platfrom called cluster, 
its aim is to provide the user with the ability to channel thier social environment towards a chosen emotional experience,
so the user will be able to find people that give them the life experience of an emotion they choose. 
<br>
<br>
I hope you like my practice blog.
<br> 
Have a good day
