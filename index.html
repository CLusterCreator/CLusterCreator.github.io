Hello

<br>
<br>

So when it comes to thinking about me i like to think about how its kinda true that 
with life experience that helps us align a high discovery, we have a choice 
that we can make to find ourselves within each moment
so i would say that i like to think of myself as a learner. 

<br>
<br>

im attending dev academy so i can build a social networking platfrom called cluster, 
its aim is to provide the user with the ability to channel thier social environment towards a chosen emotional experience,
so the user will be able to find people that give them the life experience of an emotion they choose. 

<br>
<br>

I hope you like my practice blog.

<br> 

Have a good day 

<br>
