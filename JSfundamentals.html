         <h1> Javascript Fundamentals </h1>
         <br>

 
   <h2> What is JavaScript? </h2>
        

   JavaScript is a Scripting language.<br>
   It's all over the client-side of most webpages <br><br>
   
   In a more simple explaination, <br>
   HTML and CSS show the static content on a site <br>
   while JavaScript does the movements.<br><br>

   there's a well known analogy that uses a house. <br>
   The house's framing and wall locations are HTML <br>
   The paint colours and design are CSS. <br>
   The plumbing and wiring are JavaScript.

 <br><br>

<h2>A method used to breakdown the <br>learning process of writing JS </h2>
 
You can break down the logic of JavaScript into three parts <br>

 
 Objects,
 Functions and 
 Control Flow

<br> <br>

<h2> Objects </h2>

Objects are like the information in a container. 
<br>
so in an example to help clarify <br><br>

let FavoriteColor = "black"<br><br>

That JavaScript code represents declaring a variable<br>
 with the let keyword, <br>
 naming that variable favouriteColour,<br> 
 and giving it a value of "black"<Br>

You could now reuse that favouriteColour variable<br> somewhere else in your code, <br>
and retrieve the "black" value <br><br>

Objects can go far beyond simple <br>single-layer variable declarations tho, <br>
they can also represent collections.<br><br>

Consider the scenario where we have a group of people, <br>
and we want to record all of their favourite colours.<br> 
Declaring a variable for each
code example showing multiple favourite colours would be like<br> <br>
let tomsColour = 'blue',<br>
 let sarashsColour='green',<br>
  let gregsColour = 'white'<br><br>

this way would be slow and annoying <br>and make a larger amount of code,<br><br>
We could, instead, <br>store those variables inside a more complex object<br><br>

code example declaring multiple favourite colours<br> as key-value-pairs in a JS object. <br><br>

let favourColours = {}<br>
favouriteColours.lily = "blue"<br>
favouriteColours.greg = "green"<br>

<br>

We can edit and retrieve values from the object with a key, <br>
which in this case is the name of the person in the list.

         <h2>Functions</h2>

         Functions teach reusable logic of code<br>
         They are a put together set of instructions that can apply parameters <br>
         so other user-defined functions and objects can be <br>
         used again as part of their logic <br><br>
         This is very helpful as without functions we would <Br>
         need to recreate logic constantly, and there would be a mess. <br><br>
         
         Consider a task like cleaning the house, 
         there are many tasks that need to be done, 
         reusable skills that are used for most cleaning tasks<br> 
         wiping a table for example, <br>
         is usually always a similar process.
         <br>
         <br>

         function kitchentable (){
            wipetable(kitchen)}
         <br>
         function diningtable (){
            wipetable(dining)
         }
         <br>
         function wipetable (tables){
         }
         <br><br>

         
         so if we didnt have functions, <br>
         we would have to recreate the logic for wiping tables each time<br><br><br>


        <h2> Control Flow </h2>

The control flow is the order code is executed<br><br>
a straight-forward version of this <Br>
is executing code from top-to-bottom.<br> <br>

Calling a function makes the code in that function execute <Br>
before continuing from the point that called that function <br>
functions can also call other functions<Br><br>


  <h2> Loops </h2>

A loop allows code to be executed more then once in sequence <br><br>

for example a loop needs a variable,<br>
 then the loop will run until the variable has reached its givin limit <Br>
  the loop needs to increase i by one after each loop with i++ <br>
     On each step of the loop the console logs the value of i<br>
       Then when i meets the condition <br>
       of being greater than its given limit the loop terminates <br>
       and the control flow continues <br>
      in the same top-to-bottom manner<br><br>


      <h2> How does JS interact with HTML and CSS? </h2>
      <br>
      The DOM (Document Object Model) is the key component
<br>
      The DOM is a document that consists of a logical tree<br>
      from a root thru branches that terminate in nodes <br>
      Ultimately, a web-browser interprets this DOM to display a webpage<br>
      JavaScript can manipulate the DOM through a number of interfaces<br><br>
